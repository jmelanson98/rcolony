#' A wizard-like function to help build Colony2 input files.
#'
#' This function prompts the user to provide information about their system in
#' order to correctly build and format a Colony2 input file.
#'
#' This wizard will guide the user through the process of creating an input
#' file to be executed by Colony2.
#'
#' \emph{Dataset name.} Provide a name for the dataset.
#'
#' \emph{Output file name.} Provide a name for the output file.
#'
#' \emph{Note for the project.} You can enter any text here, such as when you
#' set up the project, notes about the dataset, etc.
#'
#' \emph{Number of offspring.} Provide the number of offspring present in the
#' sample.
#'
#' \emph{Number of loci.} Provide the maximum number of marker loci genotyped
#' for the individuals in your sample.
#'
#' \emph{Random number seed.} Provide a seed for the random number generator.
#' Colony takes a simulated annealing algorithm to search for the ML
#' configuration. It is a Monte Carlo method similar to MCMC, with a fine
#' control of re-configuration acceptance rate though "temperature". Starting
#' from the initial configuration in which all individuals are unrelated except
#' for those individuals with known relationships, a random change is made to
#' part of the configuration to generate a new configuration. The likelihoods
#' of the new and old configurations are then calculated and compared to
#' determine whether the new one is accepted or rejected. If the new likelihood
#' is larger than the old one, then the new configuration is accepted.
#' Otherwise, an acceptance rate is calculated using the current temperature,
#' the new and old likelihood values, and is compared with a random number
#' drawn from a uniform distribution in the range of [0,1]. If the random
#' number value is smaller than the acceptance rate, the new configuration is
#' still accepted although it is inferior to the old one. This is intended to
#' avoid the algorithm getting stuck on a local maximum in the likelihood
#' surface. Therefore, the random number seed partially determines the
#' searching path. With exactly the same data and parameter values, different
#' runs using different random number seeds may give slightly different final
#' best configuration and likelihood values. Such a case occurs occasionally
#' when there is not enough information in the maker data to infer the genetic
#' structure, the actual genetic structure of the sample is extremely weak, or
#' the sample size is very large (i.e. thousands of individuals). For example,
#' when the number of markers is small, and/or the markers are not informative
#' (few alleles with uneven frequency distribution), and/or most families are
#' extremely small (e.g. one offspring per sibship), it is difficult to have
#' replicate runs (using different random number seeds) converge to the same
#' best configuration. One can do multiple runs for the same dataset by using
#' different random number seeds to check/confirm the reliability of the
#' analysis results. In the case replicate runs yield different results, the
#' good news is that relationships reliably inferred are usually reconstructed
#' consistently among runs, while dubious relationships are inferred
#' inconsistently among the runs. One just needs to focus on those reliable,
#' consistent relationships and ignore (abandon) those unreliable, inconsistent
#' relationships in downstream analyses.
#'
#' \emph{Should allele frequency be updated?} Allele frequencies are required
#' in calculating the likelihood of a configuration. These frequencies can be
#' provided by the user (see below) or are calculated by Colony using the
#' genotypes in OFS, CMS (optional) and CFS (optional). In the latter case, you
#' can ask Colony to update allele frequency estimates by taking into account
#' of the inferred sibship and parentage relationships during the process of
#' searching for the maximum likelihood configuration. However, updating allele
#' frequencies could increase computational time substantially, and may not
#' improve relationship inference much if the genetic structure of your sample
#' is not strong (i.e. family sizes small and evenly distributed, most
#' candidates are not assigned parentage). I suggest not updating allele
#' frequencies except when family sizes (unknown) are large relative to sample
#' size.
#'
#' \emph{Species ploidy.} Select whether the species is diploid or
#' haplodiploid.  Colony can be used for both diploid species and haplodiploid
#' species. In both cases, the offspring are always assumed to be diploid (for
#' haploid offspring, please use a previous version of Colony). In the
#' haplodiploid case, males and females are assumed to be haploid and diploid
#' respectively (for species with diploid males and haploid females, you just
#' need to swap the two sexes).
#'
#' \emph{Male and female mating system.} You will be asked whether males, and
#' females are monogamous or polygamous. Here in our specific context, male
#' monogamous signifies that two offspring in the OFS sample must be fathered
#' by 2 different males if they have separate mothers. In other words, male
#' monogamous specifies that no paternal halfsibs exist in the OFS sample. Note
#' that the mating system herein is defined with regard to the samples being
#' analyzed, not to the population or species from where the samples are taken.
#' For example, consider a population in which males mate singly with females
#' in a breeding season but mate with different females in different breeding
#' seasons. An OFS sample with individuals taken from multiple breeding seasons
#' may contain offspring from different mothers but from a single male (i.e.
#' paternal halfsibs). Therefore, for the purpose of the Colony analysis, the
#' male mating system should still be set as polygamous. The female mating
#' system is similarly defined. Note also that when both males and females are
#' defined as polygamous and the markers have genotyping errors, the
#' computation can become very slow simply because all offspring in the OFS can
#' be related in the pedigree and must be considered together in computing the
#' likelihood of a configuration.
#'
#' \emph{Sibship size prior.} You can choose to use or not use a prior
#' distribution for the paternal and maternal sibship sizes of the offspring.
#' Select NO if you have no idea about the average sibship size, or you simply
#' do not want to use a prior. Select Yes if you have a rough estimate of the
#' average paternal and maternal sibship sizes and want to use them in the
#' inference. If you select YES, you are required to provide the average
#' paternal (\eqn{np}) and maternal (\eqn{nm}) sibship sizes. Using paternal
#' sibship prior as an example, the prior probability is calculated using
#' Ewen's sampling formula as follows. Suppose paternal sibship size
#' distribution is \eqn{m = {m1, m2,\ldots , mn}}, where \eqn{mi (i=1, \ldots,
#' n)} is the number of paternal sibships each consisting of exactly \eqn{i}
#' offspring. The total number of offspring is \deqn{k= \sum_{i=1}^1 im_i}, and
#' the average number of non-empty paternal sibships (= the number of
#' contributing fathers) is \deqn{k= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \alpha/(i+\alpha)}, where
#' \eqn{\alpha} is a concentration parameter that determines the degree to
#' which individuals are allocated to the same father. We can substitute
#' \eqn{k} by \deqn{n/np} and solve numerically for \eqn{\alpha}. Given
#' \eqn{\alpha}, the prior probability of \eqn{m={m1, m2, \ldots, mn}} is
#' \deqn{\frac{n!}{\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (\alpha+i)} \prod_{i=1}^{n}
#' \biggl(\frac{\alpha}{i}\biggr)^{m_i} \frac{1}{m_i!}}.
#'
#' Note that whenever the male or female mating system parameters have changed,
#' the sibship prior is reset automatically to the default value. Therefore, if
#' you decide to use the sibship prior, you should input the prior parameters
#' \emph{after} setting the mating system parameters.
#'
#' \emph{Allele frequency (known/unknown).} You should indicate whether
#' population allele frequencies are known or unknown. If you select unknown
#' the allele frequencies will be estimated from the current dataset. If you
#' select known, because, for examplepopulation allele frequencies have been
#' estimated from another larger, more appropriate sample, you will be prompted
#' to select the allele frequency file. The file should be prepared, before
#' selection, in the following format.
#'
#' Each locus takes 2 consecutive rows. The first row lists the allele
#' names/identifications (using an unique integer number, 1-999999999), and the
#' second row lists the corresponding frequencies of the alleles. Alleles (or
#' allele frequencies) on the same row should be separated by a comma or white
#' space. The first two rows are for locus 1, the 3rd and 4th rows are for
#' locus 2, etc. Within a locus, allele names/identifications must unique but
#' are not necessarily ordered or sequential. Alleles at different loci are
#' allowed to have the same identification number.
#'
#' An example file of the allele frequency data is shown below.
#'
#' Note that when allele frequencies are specified as known, the allele
#' frequency file loaded should contain all alleles found in the offspring and
#' candidate genotypes. Otherwise, an error occurs in running Colony. Note also
#' that for a dominant locus, only two alleles are allowed and they are always
#' indexed as 1 to indicate the dominant allele (presence of a band) and 2 to
#' indicate the recessive allele (absence of a band when homozygous).
#'
#' The function will check the loaded file for number of loci, and that the
#' frequencies are numeric rather than characters.
#'
#' \emph{Number of runs:} For the same dataset and parameters of a project,
#' multiple runs can be conducted so that the best configuration with the
#' maximum likelihood is more likely to be found and the uncertainties of the
#' estimates (see below) are more reliable. However, it is very time costly to
#' do multiple runs. Furthermore, in typical situations a single run suffices.
#'
#' \emph{Length of run:} Longer runs consider more configurations in the
#' searching process and thus are more likely to find the maximum likelihood
#' configuration, but take more time to do so. In most cases, a medium run is a
#' good compromise.
#'
#' Note that marker loci have an implicit order which should be followed
#' consistently in the entire input. For example, in offspring, candidate male
#' and female genotype data, in allele frequency data and in marker type and
#' genotyping error data, the same order of marker loci must be followed. In
#' all these files, the first locus or locus 1, for example, must refer to the
#' same marker.
#'
#' \emph{Monitor by iteration, or by time in seconds?} Indicate whether you
#' wish to monitor by iteration, or by time in seconds.
#'
#' \emph{Monitor interval.} Give a number to specify the interval by which
#' intermediate results are directed to the monitor. The unit of the interval
#' is number of iterates or seconds, depending on how you choose to monitor
#' Colony.
#'
#' \emph{Platform.} Indicate what computer platform the file is intended to run
#' on (Microsoft Windows/Other).
#'
#' \emph{Likelihood method.} Indicate whether full or pairwise likelihood
#' methods should be used.
#'
#' \emph{Precision.} Indicate whether low, medium, or high precision should be
#' used in the analysis.
#'
#' \emph{Select the marker type and error rate file.} You will be prompted to
#' select the file for the markers. In the file, 4 values are provided for each
#' marker (in columns). The first value (on row 1) specifies the marker name or
#' ID (consisting of a maximum of 20 letters/numbers, others such as space,
#' comma, full stop, forward and backward slashes are not allowed in the
#' name/ID). The second (on row 2) indicates the marker type, whether it is
#' codominant (0) or dominant (1). The third and fourth values (on rows 3 and 4
#' respectively) give the allelic dropout rate and the rate of other kinds of
#' genotyping errors (including mutations) of the marker. For more information
#' about the models of genotyping errors, see \cite{Wang (2004)}.
#'
#' Note that this file sets the order of marker loci that must be followed in
#' all the following input. The first column is for locus 1, the second for
#' locus 2, etc.
#'
#' Note also that computation becomes slow when markers suffer from genotyping
#' errors. This is especially obvious when both males and females are specified
#' as polygamous.
#'
#' An example file is shown below. Note the column headers should not be
#' included in the file. The column headers are added by rcolony automatically
#' when loading the file. This is true for all of the following files loaded
#' into rcolony.
#'
#' \tabular{rrrrr}{ mk1 \tab mk2 \tab mk3 \tab mk4 \tab mk5 \cr 0 \tab 0 \tab 0
#' \tab 0 \tab 0 \cr 0.0000 \tab 0.0000 \tab 0.0000 \tab 0.0000 \tab 0.0000 \cr
#' 0.0001 \tab 0.0001 \tab 0.0001 \tab 0.0001 \tab 0.0001 }
#'
#' \emph{Offspring genotypes.}
#'
#' You will be prompted to select the offspring genotype file. The file
#' contains the individual IDs and the genotypes at each locus. Each individual
#' takes a single row. The first column gives the individual ID (a string
#' containing a maximum of 20 letters and/or numbers, no other characters are
#' allowed), the 2nd and 3rd columns give the alleles observed for the
#' individual at the first locus, the 4th and 5th give the alleles observed for
#' the individual at the 2nd locus, etc. An allele is identified by an integer,
#' in the range of 1-999999999. If the locus is a dominant marker, then only
#' one (instead of 2) column is required for the marker, and the value for the
#' genotype should be either 1 (dominant phenotype, presence of a band) or 2
#' (recessive phenotype, absence of a band). Missing genotypes are indicated by
#' 0 0 for a codominant marker and 0 for a dominant marker. Note that offspring
#' IDs should be unique. They are case sensitive, which means that, for
#' example, "offspring2" and "Offspring2" are treated as different. An
#' offspring with missing genotypes at all loci (no marker information at all)
#' should not be included in the offspring genotype file.
#'
#' Part of an example offspring genotype file is shown below. Note the column
#' headers (e.g. Offspring) should not be included in the offspring genotype
#' file. They are added by rcolony automatically when loaded.
#'
#' [table removed]
#'
#' rcolony checks the number of individuals and the number of loci present in
#' the file.
#'
#' \emph{Probability an actual father included in candidates}.  Provide a guess
#' (estimate) of the probability that the actual father of an offspring in the
#' OFS is included in the CMS sample.
#'
#' \emph{Number of candidate fathers.} Provide the number of candidate males
#' included in the CMS sample. Note that known fathers are also included in the
#' CMS sample. The minimum value is 0, in which case paternity is not inferred.
#'
#' \emph{Select the candidate father data file.} The format of male genotype
#' file is the same as the offspring genotype file, except for 2 cases. One is
#' that, for haplodiploid species (in which males are assumed to be haploid),
#' each locus takes just one column rather than 2 columns, no matter the marker
#' is codominant or dominant. The other is that if an individual already
#' included in the offspring genotype file is present in the candidate male
#' file, it is not necessary to provide its genotypes, just the first column
#' for its individual ID will do.
#'
#' rcolony will check the number of individuals and loci in the file
#'
#' \emph{Probability an actual mother included in candidates}.  Provide a guess
#' (estimate) of the probability that the actual mother of an offspring in the
#' OFS is included in the CMS sample.
#'
#' \emph{Number of candidate mothers.} Provide the number of candidate females
#' included in the CMS sample. Note that known mothers are also included in the
#' CMS sample. The minimum value is 0, in which case maternity is not inferred.
#'
#' \emph{Select the candidate mother data file.} When the number of candidate
#' females is larger than 0, the user is asked to load a file containing the
#' candidate female genotypes. The format of female genotype file is the same
#' as the offspring genotype file, except that if an individual already
#' included in the offspring genotype file is present in the candidate female
#' file, it is not necessary to provide its genotypes, just the first column
#' for its individual ID will do.
#'
#' rcolony will check the number of individuals and loci in the file
#'
#' \emph{Number of known paternal diads.} Provide the number of known
#' paternal-offspring diads included in the samples. The minimum value is 0.
#'
#' \emph{Select the paternal diads file.} If the number of known paternal diads
#' is larger than zero, then you will be prompted to select a file for the
#' known paternal diads. This file should have 2 columns, the first gives
#' father ID, while the second gives the corresponding offspring ID.
#'
#' \emph{Number of known maternal diads.} Provide the number of known
#' maternal-offspring diads included in the samples. The minimum value is 0.
#'
#' \emph{Select the maternal diads file.} If the number of known maternal diads
#' is larger than zero, then you will be prompted to select a file for the
#' known maternal diads. This file should have 2 columns, the first gives
#' mother ID, while the second gives the corresponding offspring ID.
#'
#' \emph{Number of known paternal sibships.} Provide the number of known
#' paternal sibship or paternity included in the samples. The minimum value is
#' 0. A known paternal sibship contains all of the offspring in the OFS sample
#' who are known to share the same father no matter whether the father is known
#' or not.
#'
#' \emph{Select the paternal sibships file.} If the number of known paternal
#' sibship/paternity is larger than zero, then you will be prompted to select a
#' file for the known paternal sibship/paternity. In the file, each known
#' paternal sibship/paternity takes a row, with the first column containing the
#' father ID/name if the male is known and included in the candidate males or a
#' value of 0 to indicate that the father is unknown or not in the candidate
#' males. From the 2nd column on, the ID/name of each member of the paternal
#' sibship is listed.
#'
#' \emph{Number of known maternal sibships.} Provide the number of known
#' maternal sibship or maternity included in the samples. The minimum value is
#' 0. A known maternal sibship contains all of the offspring in the OFS sample
#' who are known to share the same mother no matter whether the mother is known
#' or not.
#'
#' \emph{Select the maternal sibships file.} If the number of known maternal
#' sibship/maternity is larger than zero, then you will be prompted to select a
#' file for the known maternal sibship/maternity. In the file, each known
#' maternal sibship/maternity takes a row, with the first column containing the
#' mother ID/name if the male is known and included in the candidate females or
#' a value of 0 to indicate that the mother is unknown or not in the candidate
#' females. From the 2nd column on, the ID/name of each member of the maternal
#' sibship is listed.
#'
#' \emph{Define the number of excluded paternities.} Provide the number of
#' offspring that each has at least one known excluded candidate male as its
#' father. The minimum value is 0.
#'
#' \emph{Provide a path to the excluded paternities file.} If the number of
#' offspring with known excluded paternity is larger than zero, then you will
#' be prompted to select a file that specifies the excluded candidate males for
#' an offspring. Each offspring with excluded paternity takes one row. The
#' first entry of the row is the offspring ID/name, followed by the IDs of the
#' candidate males that are excluded parentage.
#'
#' \emph{Define the number of excluded maternities.} Provide the number of
#' offspring that each has at least one known excluded candidate female as its
#' mother. The minimum value is 0.
#'
#' \emph{Provide a path to the excluded maternities file.} If the number of
#' offspring with known excluded maternity is larger than zero, then you will
#' be prompted to select a file that specifies the excluded candidate females
#' for an offspring. Each offspring with excluded maternity takes one row. The
#' first entry of the row is the offspring ID/name, followed by the IDs of the
#' candidate females that are excluded parentage.
#'
#' \emph{Number of offspring with known excluded paternal sibships.} Provide
#' the number of offspring that are known to each have at least one excluded
#' offspring as its paternal sibling. The minimum value is 0.
#'
#' \emph{Excluded paternal shibships file.} If the number of offspring with
#' known excluded paternal sibships is larger than zero, then you will be
#' prompted to select a file that specifies the excluded offspring as paternal
#' siblings for an offspring. Each offspring with one or more excluded paternal
#' siblings takes one row. The first entry of the row is the offspring ID/name,
#' followed by the IDs of the offsprings that are excluded paternal siblings.
#'
#' \emph{Number of offspring with known excluded maternal sibships.} Provide
#' the number of offspring that are known to each have at least one excluded
#' offspring as its maternal sibling. The minimum value is 0.
#'
#' \emph{Excluded maternal shibships file.} If the number of offspring with
#' known excluded maternal sibships is larger than zero, then you will be
#' prompted to select a file that specifies the excluded offspring as maternal
#' siblings for an offspring. Each offspring with one or more excluded maternal
#' siblings takes one row. The first entry of the row is the offspring ID/name,
#' followed by the IDs of the offsprings that are excluded maternal siblings.
